# W4P1-JavaScript

Write a JavaScript program that allows the user to enter 10 integer values,
and stores those values in an array. Calculate the average value of all the
array elements, and then show an output message counting the number
of elements that are above, and the number of elements that are below
the average.

Devise multiple test cases for your program, and carry out testing to
ensure that your program delivers the expected results.
